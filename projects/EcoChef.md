**Project Description:**
An Android app designed to reduce food waste by allowing users to select ingredients or dietary requirements to find relevant recipes.

**Key Features:**
- **Ingredient Selection:** Enabled users to select ingredients they have on hand to find relevant recipes, reducing food waste. [Figure 1]
- **Preference Selection:** A feature allowing users to set dietary preferences and restrictions for personalized recipe recommendations. [Figure 2]
- **Recipe Scraping:** Implemented a scraping mechanism to extract recipes from the BBC Foods website based on user selections. [Figure 3]
- **Interactive/Appealing UI:** Set up an interactive and appealing UI to enhance user experience, user retention and engagement. [Figure 4]
- **Extensive Testing:** Conducted extensive testing to ensure app functionality and performance.

**Technologies Used:**
- Kotlin
- Java
- Web Scraping

**Project Duration:**
- November 2023 - January 2024

**Role and Responsibilities:**
- Set up the UI design.
- Add preferences to the web scraping process.
- Researched various techniques for recipe displaying.
- Bug-fixed the recipe selection and recipe searching screen.
- Designed and implemented the preferences selection.
- Test all features of the app.

**Challenges Faced:**
Handling diverse dietary requirements and ensuring the accuracy of scraped data was challenging. These issues were resolved by implementing robust filtering mechanisms and error handling during the scraping process.
Since this was the first time for all team members to program with Kotlin, a significant portion of our time was dedicated to debugging and refining functions while simultaneously learning the language.

**Achievements and Outcomes:**
- Received positive feedback from users for its ease of use and helpfulness in reducing food waste.
