**Project Description:**
A web application that allows users to upload tennis tournament data and individual match results. The system automatically allocates points based on user-defined targets, stores and retrieves game data from a MySQL database, and displays an automatically generated tournament bracket.

**Key Features:**
- **Data Upload:** Allows users to upload tennis tournament data and match results for individual players. [Figure 1]
- **Automated Points Allocation:** Automatically allocates points to players based on targets set by the shareholder (user). [Figure 2]
- **Database Integration:** Stores and retrieves game data using a MySQL database, ensuring data persistence and accessibility. [Figure 3]
- **Tournament Bracket Display:** Automatically generates and displays a tournament bracket based on the uploaded data. [Figure 4]

**Technologies Used:**
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Flask
- Database: MySQL

**Project Duration:**
- Start Date to End Date (e.g., March 2024 - July 2024)

**Role and Responsibilities:**
- Designed and implemented the user interface for data upload and tournament bracket display.
- Developed the backend functionality for automated points allocation and data storage.
- Integrated the MySQL database for storing and retrieving game data.
- Conducted testing to ensure functionality and data integrity.

**Challenges Faced:**
Challenges included ensuring accurate point allocation based on variable user-defined targets and maintaining data consistency between the application and the MySQL database. Solutions included implementing robust validation and error-handling mechanisms.

**Achievements and Outcomes:**
- Successfully implemented an automated system for points allocation and tournament bracket generation.
