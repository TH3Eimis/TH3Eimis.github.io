summary: "Program trained on solar panel data that can then be used to predict the viability (via RFC) and the energy generation (via SVR) of a solar panel in a given location."

<hr>
<p>The prediction algorithm was trained on Bristol weather patterns and solar efficiency (https://opendata.bristol.gov.uk/datasets/bcc::solar-potential/about).</p>
<p>The algorithm was trained on 5 key factors these factors are: Insolation Irradiance (kWh per year), Area (m2), Electrical Generation (kWh per year), CO2 Saving (kg per year), Solar PV Capacity (kWp)</p>
